    "instruction": "I'm running Manim but getting an error message: 'there are no scenes inside that module'. What are the common reasons for this?",
    "answer": "This error typically occurs for one of these reasons:\n1.  **File Not Saved:** You edited the Python file containing your `Scene` class but forgot to save the changes.\n2.  **Incorrect Filename:** You might have misspelled the Python filename when running the `manim` command.\n3.  **Version Mismatch:** You could be using the wrong `manim` executable, possibly one installed by `manimgl` instead of the community version (`manim`). Check your version using `manim --version`; the community version output starts with `Manim Community v...`. If it's the wrong version, you can try reinstalling `manim`, using the `manimce` command, or running Manim via `python -m manim your_script.py YourSceneName`."

    "instruction": "Why does my Manim animation only render a black frame, even though I've added code to create objects and animations?",
    "answer": "The most likely reason for rendering only a black frame is that the method containing your animation code inside your `Scene` class is not named exactly `construct`. Manim specifically looks for a method named `construct` to execute the scene's content. Double-check the spelling.\n\n```python\nfrom manim import Scene, Square\n\nclass MyScene(Scene):\n    # Ensure this method is named 'construct'\n    def construct(self):\n        sq = Square()\n        self.play(Create(sq))\n        # Your animation code here\n```\nIf your code is in a differently named method, Manim won't run it unless that method is called from within `construct`."

    "instruction": "What are the default dimensions and coordinate system of a Manim scene?",
    "answer": "A standard Manim scene has the following default measurements:\n*   **Height:** 8 Manim units.\n*   **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9.\n*   **Width:** Calculated as `8 * 16 / 9`, which is approximately 14.22 (or `14 + 2/9`) Manim units.\n*   **Origin (0,0,0):** Located at the exact center of the scene.\n*   **Coordinates:** The y-axis ranges from -4 to 4, and the x-axis ranges from approximately -7.11 to +7.11. The top-left corner, for instance, has coordinates `[-7-1/9, 4, 0]`."

    "instruction": "How can I find out all the possible configuration options (keyword arguments) I can pass when creating a specific Manim object, like a Circle?",
    "answer": "To discover the keyword arguments for a Manim object (Mobject) like `Circle`:\n1.  **Check the object's documentation:** The specific documentation page for `Circle` will list its unique arguments (e.g., `radius`, `color`).\n2.  **Consult base class documentation:** Mobjects inherit arguments from their parent classes. `Circle` inherits from `Arc`, which inherits from others. Look for `**kwargs` in the documentation â€“ this indicates arguments are passed up the inheritance chain. Check the documentation for base classes like `Arc`, `VMobject`, and `Mobject`, as they define many common styling arguments (e.g., `stroke_color`, `fill_opacity`, `stroke_width`).\n3.  **Use `help()` or IDE tools:** In a Python environment, you can try `help(Circle)` or use your IDE's features to inspect the class's `__init__` method signature."

  {
    "instruction": "How do I make Manim render a video with a transparent background?",
    "answer": "To render a video with transparency, use the command-line flag `-t` or its longer form `--transparent` when running Manim.\n\nExample:\n```bash\nmanim -pql your_script.py YourSceneName --transparent\n```\n\nNote that the default output format (`.mp4`) does not support transparency. Manim will automatically output a `.mov` file instead. If you need other transparency-supporting formats, you can specify them with `--format`:\n\n*   For WebM: `manim ... -t --format=webm`\n*   For GIF: `manim ... -t --format=gif`"

    "instruction": "I'm following a Manim tutorial I found online, but the code doesn't work with my current Manim installation. Why might this be happening?",
    "answer": "The tutorial you are watching is likely using an older version of Manim. Manim has undergone changes over time, including renaming functions or changing how things work. To follow along, you could either:\n1.  Install the specific Manim version used in the tutorial (if known).\n2.  Adapt the code from the tutorial to work with your current Manim version. This might involve looking up equivalent functions or methods in the current Manim documentation.\nCheck the video description or tutorial notes, as the creator might have mentioned updates or required changes for newer versions."

  {
    "instruction": "When using `Tex` or `MathTex` objects in Manim, some characters or letters are missing in the output. How can I fix this?",
    "answer": "Missing characters in `Tex` or `MathTex` often indicate a problem with the font cache in your underlying LaTeX distribution. You may need to rebuild the fonts.\n\nFor many TeX distributions (like TeX Live), you can try running the following command in your terminal:\n```bash\nfmtutil -sys --all\n```\nThis command rebuilds the system-wide format files and font caches. If this command doesn't work or you use a different distribution (like MiKTeX), please consult the documentation for your specific LaTeX distribution on how to update or rebuild font caches."

    "instruction": "How do I convert Manim code written for the older `manimgl` version that uses `CONFIG` dictionaries to the current community version style?",
    "answer": "The community version of Manim (`manim`) doesn't use `CONFIG` dictionaries. Here's how to update the code:\n\n1.  **For simple class attributes:** If `CONFIG` set basic key-value pairs used as attributes within the class, define them directly as class attributes:\n    *   *Old:* `class MyScene(Scene): CONFIG = {\"rate\": 0.5}`\n    *   *New:* `class MyScene(Scene): rate = 0.5`\n\n2.  **For initialization parameters (especially inherited ones):** If `CONFIG` keys were intended as initialization arguments (like styling for Mobjects, often passed to parent classes), define them as parameters in the `__init__` method and pass relevant ones to `super().__init__`:\n    *   *Old:* \n    ```python\n    class OldThing(VMobject):\n        CONFIG = {\"stroke_color\": RED, \"custom_arg\": 1}\n    ```\n    *   *New:*\n    ```python\n    from manim import VMobject, RED\n    \n    class NewThing(VMobject):\n        def __init__(self, stroke_color=RED, custom_arg=1, **kwargs):\n            self.custom_arg = custom_arg # Handle custom args\n            super().__init__(stroke_color=stroke_color, **kwargs) # Pass parent args\n    ```"

    "instruction": "Manim fails during LaTeX processing with an error related to PDF to SVG conversion or `dvisvgm`. How can I diagnose and fix this?",
    "answer": "This issue often relates to `dvisvgm`'s ability to use Ghostscript for PDF processing. Here's how to troubleshoot:\n1.  **Check `dvisvgm` Version:** Run `dvisvgm --version`. Ensure it's at least v2.4. Update it via your LaTeX distribution if needed.\n2.  **Check PostScript Support:** Run `dvisvgm -l`. Look for the line `ps dvips PostScript specials`. If missing, `dvisvgm` likely needs Ghostscript.\n3.  **Check for Ghostscript Library (`libgs`) Flag:** Run `dvisvgm -h`. If it shows a `--libgs=filename` option, `dvisvgm` needs the path to your Ghostscript library.\n4.  **Locate Ghostscript Library:** Search for `libgs.so` (Linux), `gsdll32.dll`/`gsdll64.dll` (Windows), or `libgsl.dylib` (macOS). It might be in system library paths or the Ghostscript installation directory.\n5.  **Set `LIBGS` Environment Variable:** Set the `LIBGS` variable to the full path of the library file found. \n    *   Linux/macOS: `export LIBGS=/path/to/libgs.so`\n    *   Windows: `set LIBGS=C:\\path\\to\\gsdll64.dll`\n6.  **Verify:** Rerun `dvisvgm -l`. It should now list PostScript support. You can also run `dvisvgm -V1` to check if it finds Ghostscript.\n7.  **Persistence:** Configure your system to set the `LIBGS` variable automatically for future sessions.\n8.  **Installation:** If the library file is missing, you need to install Ghostscript.\nConsult `dvisvgm`'s documentation if issues persist."

    "instruction": "Where can I find more tutorials and resources for learning Manim?",
    "answer": "The official Manim Community Discord server is an excellent place to find learning resources. It features a `#beginner-resources` channel where community members share and maintain a list of helpful guides, tutorials, and other materials for learning Manim."
